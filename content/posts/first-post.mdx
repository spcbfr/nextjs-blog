Hello friend, welcome to my first post! I am so excited because this is my first time coding something that's actually 100% mine, I usually use themes or pre-made website and change little things, but this time I decided I had enough and needed to actually learn how to code and it was a fantastic experience!

I'll later make a full write-up on how exactly I made this blog but for now here
are the main things I used:

- **Next.js** (react) as my framework of choice
- **Vercel** for deploying, it integrates very well with Next.js
- **MDX**, or more specifically [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler) to allow me have react components inside of my markdown files but I am still getting the hang of that one
- and more recently **Tailwind CSS** as I redesigned my blog using it and it's fantastic

The full source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/spcbfr/nextjs-blog" target="_blank">github</a>, feel free to look through my terible spaghetti code, but remember to Star the project

# Goals

I first created my twitter account because I needed a place to share my feelings with the world, and it surved it's purpose, but quickly I realized that I wanted my own **digital garden** you could say, where I can write and express my opinions freely and that's how this blog was born.

My goal is to try and write _the best posts possible_, and to teach the reader something new every time and to also stay consistent and post at least biweekly

# Content

This blog is not just a dev blog, I'll occasionally also post about other stuff like:

- Movies and TV shows
- Book reviews
- Hardware
- Linux
- Tech in general

That's pretty much it, as always, thanks for reading!
