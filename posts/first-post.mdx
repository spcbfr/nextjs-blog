Hello friend, welcome to my first post! I am so excited because this is my first time coding something that's actually 100% mine, I usually use themes or pre-made website and change little things, but this time I decided I had enough and needed to actually learn how to code and it was a fantastic experience!

I'll later make a full write-up on how exactly I made this blog but for now here are the main things I used:
- **Next.js** (react) as my framework of choice
- **Vercel** for deploying, it integrates very well with Next.js
- **MDX**, or more specifically [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler) to allow me have react components inside of my markdown files but I am still getting the hang of that one
