          "raw": "\nPerfectionism is often seen as a good thing, and people should try and reach it whenever they can, but that may not always be true, being a perfectionist can stop you from finishing what you started or even not start at all..\n\n## Quantity over Quality\n\nYou should aspire to make and publish so much, because only a subset of the things you publish is going to be popular and you don’t know which “thing” will be a hit because it depends on many factors that you aren’t in control of. Let’s look at some examples:\n\n- A photography professer ran a month-long experiment in which he devided his students in 2 groups, the first had to take 1 photo through out the whole month on which they will be graded, the second had to take as they can and they were graded on the number of ones they took, surprisingly the group that had more time to polish up that single photo, on average, **did worse** than the one that took more photos in a short time span\n- Irving Berlin wrote 1500 songs, out of which, only 25 hit #1, this perfectly illustrates that no one can know what things will become popular, if irving had only published the songs that _he_ tought were good, then he probably would have never gotten a single hit.\n- Ali Abdaal said in many of his [videos](https://twitter.com/aliabdaal/status/1362144792197611523) and in his [Part-time youtuber academy](https://academy.aliabdaal.com/) that the first 100 videos of any youtuber are going to be crap, so youtubers who are just starting out should focus on getting those first videos out of the way and not care much about their quality\n\nBy applying the quantity over quality motto in everything you do, you’ll eventually reach the quality you wanted to begin with, this is known as **Quality _Through_ Quantity**\n\n## Finishing vs Publishing\n\nWhen you create a thing (book, song, blog post) it's never done until you decide to publish it. you may find yourself stuck in a state where you never actually publish anything because you’re always seeking perfection. A thing is finished once you decide it’s finished, _aka_ by publishing it.\nAs an example I am about to publish this post even thought, I know it’s far from perfect, but I already spent a lot of time writting it and have shared everything I wanted to tell the world initially, if I keep going I know I’ll spend 10x the amount of time and finally publish a post that’s only 5% better instead I opted-in to publish it as it is right now and focus on making other cool ideas a reality\n\n## How do people publish so much\n\nSucessful people publish so much because they are actually working to publish not working for pleasure. Working for pleasure is very important but it only should take a limited amount of your time.\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Working to publish</th>\n      <th>Working for pleasure</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Selfless</td>\n      <td>Inward Focused</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Outward Focused</td>\n      <td>Giving to oneself</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Contributing to the world</td>\n      <td>Extremly fun</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n## Raw can be better\n\nIn certain cases, polishing up can make things look worse, that’s because humans, by nature, love when something is raw = can have mistakes = is relatable.\n\n- Pomplomoose, a band that’s very close to my heart has used a take where the singer forgot the lyrics and started laughing, most people loved this and thought it made the song so much better\n- The National Arab Orchestra ran a program called [Building Bridges Through Music](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWygykGd2MWhVO-JFk1hgclyMoCv34ktr) where they would go to schools in the USA and teach them arabic music to get a chance to sing in an orchestra, even though their arabic accent was far from perfect, it made the experience much better by allowing me, an arabic speaker who grew up listening to these songs, rediscover them in a new way.\n\n---\n\nSo that's pretty much it, I hope you enjoyed my first write-up, I'll catch you in the next one!\n",

        "body": {
          "raw": "\n## Backstory\n\nAt the start of the summer my ThinkPad T420, was getting hotter than usual, I opened it up, and turns out the fan was struggling to stay alive, which was kind of expected after a long and happy 10-year life, so I started looking for a replacement, that’s when a friend of mine reached out and offered to send me a <a href=\"https://desktop.system76.com\" target=\"_blank\">Thelio Desktop</a> he bought but never used, knowing how much of a Linux geek I am, and I happily accepted.\n\nNow 2 months have passed since I received it and that’s been enough time for me to form an opinion about it\n\n## My Configuration\n\nSystem76, the company behind the thelio, allows the user to pick every component in the machine, they offer a good selection of options for Graphics Card, RAM, and CPU and a bunch of optional accessories as well, which is something not that many companies do nowadays, anyways here is the configuration mine came with:\n\n- 32GB of RAM\n- AMD® Ryzen 5 3600x 6-core CPU\n- AMD® Radeon RX 550 GPU\n- 120GB SSD\n\nSince I got my pc, system76 stopped offering my exact configuration, but the closest build to mine that you could get right now would cost around $1300\n\n## Design\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/thelio-in-garden.JPG\" alt=\"a picture of my thelio in a garden\" />\n  <figcaption>I took it outside for a quick photoshoot!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe thelio looks absolutely stunning, it avoids that generic RGB gamer look but is still extremely elegant, the side of the case is made of quality wood that extends to the back. it is also pretty heavy and feels very well made when held.\n\nThere aren't any USB ports on the front to keep the clean look they were going for, but I honestly wouldn't mind a single port on the front for the occasional flash drive, they redeemed this by having 7 Ports on the back.\n\n## Hardware\n\nAs for the hardware, there isn't much to complain about here, you get to choose every component that goes into your machine and they have documentation for upgrading/replacing every single component, one thing that's a bit annoying is that you can't use 3.5″ hard drives, only SSDs, and 2.5″ hard drives.\n\n## Pop!\\_OS: it's not all roses\n\nThe thelio (and everything else that system76 sells) comes installed with Pop OS, their own Linux distribution based on Ubuntu. Pop OS is very well designed, it's my favorite out of the ubuntu flavors, but it doesn't offer anything special functionality-wise\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/pop-os-screenshot.png\" alt=\"A photo of my linux Pop Os Desktop\" />\n  <figcaption>My Pop OS desktop</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe team has made packages to control the fans and drivers and more, these are pre-installed in Pop Os (run `apt search system76-*`) which was nice to see\n\nspeaking of firmware packages, When I got the pc, I installed Arch Linux (because that's what I am comfortable with) and immediately I noticed that the fans were louder than usual and were running all the time even when idle, which, as you could imagine, was very irritating. apparently, I was missing some firmware packages, I thought that was an easy fix given that the system76 had the packages on arch, so I installed all of them, rebooted, and then to my surprise nothing happened, I contacted support and I got this:\n\n> [...] As our QA does not test other distros from Ubuntu or Pop we can't confirm that these packages work as they should.\n\nAfter scouring the internet for a little longer and not being able to find any solution, I gave up and went back to Pop OS.\n\nI am not sure how I am supposed to feel about this on one hand, there are hunderds of linux distros and they can't support and check all of them, on the other hand the user shouldn't feel stuck on one distro just because they couldn't get some drivers to work.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe thelio is a remarkably beautiful computer for people interested in Linux and Linux enthousiasts alike, as long as you'll stick with what comes pre-installed.\n\nI think it's a fantastic choice if you have a 1200 to 1500 dollar budget, but if you've got more than that to spend than I think buying something else and installing Pop Os on it would a better choice.\n",
